# Models Directory
This folder is a placeholder for the machine learning model and scaler files generated by `SentimentDecoder.ipynb`. These files are essential for making predictions on new audio data without retraining the model from scratch.

## Files
1. **`ser_model.pkl`**  
   - **Description**: The trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER).
   - **Purpose**: Classifies audio features into one of eight emotions (neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, surprised).
   - **Format**: Pickle file created using `joblib.dump()`.
   - **Size**: Approximately [1.1MB] (depends on feature dimensions and dataset size).

2. **`scaler.pkl`**  
   - **Description**: The feature scaler used to standardize the audio features before training and prediction.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures features (e.g., MFCCs, pitch, energy) are on the same scale, matching the training process.
   - **Format**: Pickle file created using `joblib.dump()` with `StandardScaler` from `scikit-learn`.
   - **Size**: Typically small (3KB).


## How to Generate These Files
1. **Requirements**: Ensure you have the dependencies installed (see main `README.md`) and the dataset ready (see `data/README.md`).
2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open `SentimentDecoder.ipynb` in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.
   - Execute all cells up to the `train_model()` function.
   - The `train_model()` function:
     - Trains the SVM model on the extracted features (`X.npy`, `y.npy`).
     - Saves the trained model as `ser_model.pkl`.
     - Saves the scaler as `scaler.pkl`.
3. **Output Location**: After running, these files will be saved in the same directory as the notebook unless you modify `MODEL_PATH` or the scaler path in the code.

### Example Code Snippet
```python
# From SentimentDecoder.ipynb
joblib.dump(model, "ser_model.pkl")
joblib.dump(scaler, "scaler.pkl")
print(f"Model saved to ser_model.pkl")
print("Scaler saved to scaler.pkl")
